# DeepSeek-vs-ChatGPT-R

AI Platform Performance Analysis – DeepSeek vs ChatGPT

This project presents a comprehensive analytical comparison between two AI platforms—DeepSeek and ChatGPT—focusing on user behavior, model performance, and platform engagement trends. Using a synthetic dataset simulating real-world usage, the analysis combines R for in-depth statistical modeling and forecasting, and Power BI for interactive dashboards and business-oriented visualizations.

# Objectives
Evaluate differences in performance metrics such as response accuracy, user ratings, and session duration.

Analyze user engagement, churn behavior, and retention patterns.

Forecast future trends in platform response accuracy using time series models.

Visualize findings interactively using Power BI to inform platform strategy and design.

# Key Features
# R (Statistical & Predictive Analysis)
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) – Summary stats and distribution plots for key engagement metrics.

AI Platform Comparison – Hypothesis testing and correlation analysis of user behavior and response quality.

Churn Analysis – Evaluation of churn patterns and influential factors, including logistic regression testing.

Time-Series Forecasting – Prophet-based forecasting of response accuracy over 12 months per platform.

# Power BI (Business Intelligence)
Interactive Dashboards – Pages for churn, retention, accuracy, session engagement, and query behavior.

Geo Visuals – Regional churn mapping with continent-level aggregation.

Time-Series Forecasts – Visual comparison of projected performance using built-in Power BI forecasting tools.

Filters and Slicers – Enable dynamic exploration by platform, region, and user type.

# Visual Outputs
